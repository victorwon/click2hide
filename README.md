## Installation

1. Download the latest version of Click2Hide.dmg from the [Releases](https://github.com/victorwon/click2hide/releases) page.
2. Open the dmg file, drag and drop the Click2Hide.app to the Applications folder.
3. You may now open the Click2Hide.app from the Applications folder and follow the steps to bypass the gatekeeper on MacOS Sequoia. This is a one-time procedure. For MacOS Ventura and Sonoma, only the last two steps are necessary. Additionally, this is an open-source application. Therefore, in the event of any security concerns, you may verify the code to ease your mind.
